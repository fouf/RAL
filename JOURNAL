--------------------------------------------
->The idea for my project, RAL - Rapidly Adapting Lifeforms, sprung about. After brainstorming for a while, I refined the idea to attempt
and replicate a small colony of tiny pixels that expand and fight off any prey and survive by managing nearby resources.

-> Worked on the SDL environment in C, so far things are looking good, tomorrow I hopefully start some of the more "simulating" parts of the project.

January 11th, 2011
--------------------------------------------
-> Worked on a lot of the idea behind the project, set up lots of structs to hold neccessary data for simulation

Feburary 8th, 2011
--------------------------------------------
-> I have been questioning my idea while refining my coding environment for the past month. I have concluded that it will still be a simulation,
but rather a predator/prey model, and relate it to real-world equations that measure populations.
I believe that a computer simulatued predator prey enviorment will be very similar to real world equations used today.
->At the moment I have a grid that will be used as the "field" for the simulation, different colored dots will repersent the predators and preys. 
I will hopefully have running statistics and variables that you can change to watch the effect that is has on the screen.
The field will be toroidal, meaning that the top and bottom are connected, and the left and right sides are also connected with each other.

---------------------------------------------
-> I have been looking at the idea of cellular automaton(CA). I am quite interested in the topic.. I'm going to take some time to study both of the ideas 
and then choose a path. Both Cellular autoamton and a grid based predator/prey simulator share my grid environment set up currently.. 
I just have to choose which I will make my project. Cellular automaton looks quite fun to do as I already have a demo of it working in my C/SDL environment...

Feburary 14th, 2011
---------------------------------------------
-> I have chosen my project to be about cellular automaton (Conway's Game of Life). I have been working on it for a while now, and it is looking good so far. Currently I am making it more efficient
and I am taking time to learn the hashlife algorithm, and implement in my application to quickly generate very old life patterns. It seems like a very complex but rewarding
process, both as something interesting to learn and attempt to implement and a way to help benefit my project.
I did not choose to do the predator/prey or my very first idea of adapting lifeforms for I saw this as a little more unique than the others, and more intriguing.
I already have it somewhat working, it is pretty good so far, doing about 60 generations a second... this should be greatly increased with the hashlife algorithm and
futhering tinkering on my half.
I am going to relate my cellular automaton project on how it can help us understand life. Cellular automaton can help us learn how cells divide. It is very amazing how 
a bit of cells placed in the Game of Life can turn into an amazingly abstract collection of cells. This game of life lets us observe at first hand and under a set of known
rules observe patterns.

Feburary 18th, 2011
---------------------------------------------
-> I've continued my work on the project.. currently I'm working on implementing the hash life algorithm. This will GREATLY increase the speed of the program, and allow me
to generate generations in the billions to see how complex configurations become. I'm also adding the ability to add pre-set
configurations to the application, so you can click and place a glider in a single motion, or some even more advanced.
I'm currently happy with my progress, and can't wait for this to be complete. I've also tinkered with the efficieny, it works better
than ever now.
I'll keep tackling these for now, and then I will maybe add a toolbar instead of the configuration box instead.

Feburary 25th, 2011
---------------------------------------------
-> I've reverted back to my idea of a predator versus prey model. I have found that I would enjoy doing that more, and it makes more sense for me to do that, rather than
just an implemation of cellular automaton.
Currently working on transition, should not be to much of a problem as they both us a grid like system.

March 1st, 2011
---------------------------------------------
The predator prey simulation is work as planned, it took me a while but I have it so it successfully checks the neighbours of each of the cells correctly, it is really
starting to turn out nice. I'm having trouble implementing the starve and breed factors to some of the cells, I will continue working towards that, I'm hoping to have it
so you can dynamical change these values during the simulation as to get a better feel of how the varibles directly affect the simulation.

March 15th, 2011
---------------------------------------------
I've been having trouble implementing the graph, it would work but cause problems after running for so long.. I've had to transition and implement the graph different,
it is now appended to the bottom of the screen instead of being its own window, I think it looks better now, before it looks pretty bad. I'm happy with how it is
working so far, I've added a little status menu at the bottom.

March 22nd, 2011
---------------------------------------------
I have finally got the cell's breed and rate values set up to sliders in the configuration box. Now you can change them during runtime and watch what happens to
the system as you change the bars. I really enjoy watching the simulation run now, it seems quick fast and the predators and preys look nice. At the moment I'm
tinkering with the colors, hopefully I'll choose some good ones.

March 26th, 2011
---------------------------------------------
The project is due soon and I've been working on my board and polishing up my project, I had a bug earlier where the graph wasn't working properly but that has been fixed
(phew). Hopefully my project is in good enough shape to be presented, I'm really worried about my board at the moment as I don't have a printer, hopefully I can get all
of this printed with time to put it together. Anyway, I won't be typing in here anymore until after regionals. Woo.
